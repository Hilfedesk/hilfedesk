## Does the world need another Helpdesk Application?

We built Carbon after years of building end-to-end manufacturing systems with off-the-shelf solutions. We realized that:

- Modern, API-first application didn't exist
- Vendor lock-in bordered on extortion
- There is no "perfect Helpdesk" because each company is unique

We built Hilfedesk to solve these problems ☝️. You are free to customise Hilfedesk the way you want.

## Architecture

Carbon is designed to make it easy for you to extend the platform by building your own apps through our API. We provide some examples to get you started in the [examples](https://github.com/crbnos/carbon/blob/main/examples) folder.
